# rsa-sample

While teaching my Maths-interested friend Golang, I came up with the idea to create a (very simple) RSA implementation in
Go to show what Go code looks like and how to solve fairly advanced Maths problems pretty easily in Go.

Note: I don't claim at all that this works in more advanced scenarios (or at all for larger numbers).

This is just the result of a short hacking session :)

Paper we based the Maths on (in Swedish): https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:411441/FULLTEXT01.pdf
